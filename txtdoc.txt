Steps performed:
1) Cleaned the data in excel.
2) Fixed the date format.
3) Removed unwanted columns (Umpire1,Umpire2).
4) Added values in blank cells from another columns.
   -Select Team1 col -> Find & Select -> Select Blanks & click ok -> Go to Formula Bar and press '=' -> Select col from 
   corresponding toss winner because they were the team not mentioned in Team1 col.
   -Perform above procedure with Team2.
5) Used python to insert values in blank cell of neutral venues according to there corresponding cities (indian city = 0
   ,Foreign city = 1).
   Logic:
   We will create a non-empty list to append and check whether the venue lies in India or not
   and then replace value of neutral venue with list created.
6) Then we used PowerBI to visualize the formatted data by creating a dashboard.
